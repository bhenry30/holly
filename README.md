# HOLLY | EDUCATE & CELEBRATE  
Interactive Front-End Project | Group 2  
## Project Objective  
We attempted to conceive and execute a design with our team that solves a real-world problem by integrating data received from multiple server-side API requests to create an interactive Holiday Database. We worked collaboratively, and learned agile development methodologies and implemented features, functions and bug fixes using the Git branch workflow and pull requests.   
## Description  
Holly is a web app that allows users to educate themselves about holidays and events that happen around the world every day and other interesting facts.  
## User story  
User 1 - The user wants a website to go that will show them what holidays are being celebrated around the world on that day. I want to be able to celebrate and learn something interesting every day of the year.  
User 2 - As a traveler, I want to be informed of all the holidays taking place when Iâ€™m traveling to a certain country, so I can better adapt to the culture of that country.
